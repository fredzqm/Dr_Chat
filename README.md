# Dr_Chat

This was a hackthon project at [HackIllinois 2017](https://devpost.com/software/dr-chat)

We built the bot with Microsoft bot framework, and medicAPI. 
The bot framework provides natural language processing and extracting the keywords we need to send to medicAPI. 
The API can handle the issue diagnose and treatment recommendation. 
Then we deploy the app on Azure, and allow users to access it from Slack.
